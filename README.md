# The Perfect 11: Finding the best FPL team

For the 2022-23 English Premier League season more than 10,000,000 fantasy teams were created to play in the FPL. While most of these teams are built using individuals favourite players/teams, in this project I look to take a data science approach to the question of team building.

Using data from the current and historical FPL data supplimented with data from FBref.com the previous season's data is used to predict a team for the following season.
